# Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

A simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in C++ with support for:

- **Player vs Player**
- **Player vs Computer (Easy – Random moves)**
- **Player vs AI (Hard – Minimax AI algorithm)**

This project demonstrates fundamental C++ skills such as arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and recursion, while also introducing **AI concepts** like the **Minimax adversarial search algorithm**.

## Features

- Play Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal/command prompt.
- Board labeled with rows and columns for intuitive input (1–3).
- Three game modes:
  1. **Player vs Player**
  2. **Player vs Computer (Easy)** – computer makes random moves.
  3. **Player vs AI (Hard)** – computer uses Minimax to play optimally.
- Input validation (prevents overwriting cells or out-of-range input).
- Replay option after each game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler such as **g++**.
  - On Windows: install via [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.org/).
  - On Linux/macOS: `g++` is usually available via package manager.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or any C++ IDE (optional but recommended).
